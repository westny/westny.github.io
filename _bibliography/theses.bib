  author       = {Westny, Theodor},
  abstract 	   = {Future progress toward the realization of fully self-driving vehicles still re-quires human-level social compliance, arguably 	dependent on the ability to accurately forecast the behavior of surrounding road users. Due to the inter-connected nature of traffic participants, in which the actions of one agent can significantly influence the decisions of others, the development of behavior pre-diction methods is crucial for achieving resilient autonomous motion planning. As high-quality data sets become more widely available and many vehicles already possess significant computing power, the possibility of adopting a data-driven approach for motion prediction is increasing. The first contribution is the design of an intention-prediction model based on autoencoders for highway scenarios. Specifically, the method targets the problem of data imbalance in highway traffic data using ensemble methods and data-sampling techniques. The study shows that commonly disregarded information holds potential use for improved prediction performance and the importance of dealing with the data imbalance problem. The second contribution is the development of a probabilistic motion pre-diction framework. The framework is used to evaluate various graph neural network architectures for multi-agent prediction across various traffic scenarios. The graph neural network computes the inputs to an underlying motion model, parameterized using neural ordinary differential equations. The method additionally introduces a novel uncertainty propagation approach by combining Gaussian mixture modeling and extended Kalman filtering techniques. The third contribution is attributed to the investigation of combing data-driven models with motion modeling and methods for numerical integration. The study illustrates that improved prediction performance can be achieved by the inclusion of differential constraints in the model, but that the choice of motion model as well as numerical solver can have a large impact on the prediction performance. It is also shown that the added differential constraints improve extrapolation properties compared to complete black-box approaches. The thesis illustrates the potential of data-driven methods and their usability for the behavior prediction problem. Still, there are additional challenges and interesting questions to investigate—the main one being the investigation of their use in autonomous navigation frameworks. },

	title={Modeling and Lateral Control of Tractor-Trailer Vehicles during Aggressive Maneuvers},

  abstract = {In the last decades, the development of self-driving vehicles has rapidly increased. Improvements in algorithms, as well as sensor and computing hardware have led to self-driving technologies becoming a reality. It is a technology with the potential to radically change how society interacts with transportation. One crucial part of a self-driving vehicle is control schemes that can safely control the vehicle during evasive maneuvers. This work investigates the modeling and lateral control of tractor-trailer vehicles during aggressive maneuvers. Models of various complexity are used, ranging from simple kinematic models to complex dynamic models, which model tire slip and suspension dynamics. The models are evaluated in simulations using TruckMaker, which is a high fidelity vehicle simulator. Several lateral controllers are proposed based on Model predictive control (MPC) and linear-quadratic (LQ) control techniques. The controllers use different complex prediction models and are designed to minimize the path-following error with respect to a geometric reference path. Their performance is evaluated on double lane change maneuvers of various lengths and with different longitudinal speeds. Additionally, the controllers' robustness against changes in trailer mass, weight distribution, and road traction is investigated. Extensive simulations show that dynamic prediction models are necessary to keep the control errors small when performing maneuvers that result in large lateral accelerations. Furthermore, to safely control the tractor-trailer vehicle during high speeds, it is a necessity to include a model of the trailer dynamics. The simulation study also shows that the proposed LQ controllers have trouble to evenly balance tractor and trailer deviation from the path, while the MPC controllers handle it much better. Additionally, a method for approximately weighting the trailer deviation is shown to improve the performance of both the LQ and MPC controllers. Finally, it is concluded that an MPC controller with a dynamic tractor-trailer model is robust against model errors, and can become even more robust by tuning the controller weights conservatively.},
